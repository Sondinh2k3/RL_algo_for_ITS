## Experimental regions

These regions are in experiement:

### Region 1: West

Intersections: 13 \
E2 detectors: 0 --> 74, in which:
- Border: 0 --> 61 (all detectors related to intersection on the boundary)
- Inbound: 62 -> 74 (all detectors in the region, except on the boundary)
- Out -> Region: 0 - 2, 6, 14, 19, 26, 31 - 33, 35, 38, 40, 52, 49, 56 - 58 (the rest are on the boundary and in the region)

E1 detectors: 0 --> 74, in which:
- Border: 0 --> 61
- Inbound: 62 -> 74
- Out -> Region: 0 - 2, 6, 14, 19, 25, 31 - 34, 38, 39, 51, 52, 56 - 58

### Region 2: North West

Intersections: 14 \
